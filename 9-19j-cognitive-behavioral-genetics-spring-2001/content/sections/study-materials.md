The notes below show the subtopics that are covered within each lecture.

General Overview
----------------

*   Why study cognitive and behavioral genetics?
*   Some major techniques and discoveries of behavioral genetics.
*   Nature and nurture.
*   Social and ethical concomitants of cognitive and behavioral genetics: eugenics, social Darwisinism, race, sex.

Remedial Genetics
-----------------

*   Multigene traits, QTL.

Gene Structure / Function
-------------------------

*   Gene exon/intron structure. Allelic variation.
*   Basal transcription. Cis and trans regulatory elements.
*   mRNA structure. The genetic code. Coding/non coding regions. Translational control.
*   Point mutations, small and large-scale deletions, chromosomal abnormalities.

Single Gene Mutations
---------------------

*   How can a single gene mutation lead to a complex psychiatric phenotype?
*   Animal models 1: the GABAa receptor and enhanced anxiety and bias for threat cues.
*   Animal models 2: proline deyhdrogenase and sensorimotor gating (relevance to attention deficits in multiple psychiatric disorders).

Neurogenetics
-------------

*   Mendelian genetics in the setting of neuropsychiatry.
*   How can molecular genetics be used to find the gene responsible for a human disorder inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern and to provide an explanation for the patterns of pathology which are observed: Huntington's Disease, a single gene autosomal dominant mutation.

Environmental and Genetic Context
---------------------------------

*   Genomic environment.
*   Cellular and local environment.
*   Body + brain, hormones, (estrogen).
*   External environment. Activity-dependent wiring and gene expression.

Williams Syndrome
-----------------

*   Genetic, neurobiological, cognitive, linguistic, and social dimensions of Williams Syndrome.

Genetics of Language
--------------------

*   Heritability of normal variation and pathologies of language.
*   Specific Language Impairment.
*   Dyslexia.
*   Developmental language delay.
*   Stuttering.

Challenge of Defining Phenotype
-------------------------------

*   Schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, alcoholism.
*   Diagnostic issues.
